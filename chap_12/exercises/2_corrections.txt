middle = (low + high) / 2;

middle, low and high are all pointers to certain values in an array

PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- pointer to pointer addition is not allowed
- pointer division not allowed
- risk of `middle` pointing to fractional memory (like 10.5 in hex ðŸ˜…)

SOLUTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- dereferencing, the statement becomes;
    *middle = (*low + *high) / 2;
