a) #define AVG(x, y) (x+y)/2

4/AVG(2, 3)

will evaluate to => 4/(2+3)/2 => 4/5/2
instead of => 4/((2+3)/2) => 4/(5/2)

Fix: #define AVG(x, y) (((x)+(y)) / 2)


b) #define AREA(x, y) (x)*(y)

2/AREA(2, 3)

will evaluate to => 2/2*3 => 3
instead of => 2/(2*3) => 1/3

Fix: #define AREA(x, y) ((x)*(y))
